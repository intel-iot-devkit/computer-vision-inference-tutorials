# Intel Computer Vision SDK Setup for using the Inference Engine

<>

## What you’ll learn
  * How to check your system requirements for CV SDK installation
  * How to install CV SDK with optional GPU capabilities
  * How to verify CV SDK installation

## Gather your materials
* 5th or 6th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor.  
**Note**: The generation number is embedded into the product name, right after the ‘i3’, ‘i5’, or ‘i7’.  For example, Intel Core i5-5200U and Intel Core i5-5675R are both 5th generation, and Intel Core i5-6600K and Intel Core i5 6360U are both 6th generation.  You can also find the product name in Linux by running ‘lscpu’ and look for ‘Model name:’  
* Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
* If you want to run inference on the GPU you'll need to check for some extra things.  It isn't required, but it's easier to install it now if you think you may want it.  Having it installed can be useful to compare the CPU and GPU performance of inference.  You'll need everything from above as well as:
	* A procesor with Intel® Iris Pro Graphics and HD Graphics **HOW TO CHECK?** 
	* No discrete graphics card installed (required by OpenCL)
	* No drivers for other GPUs installed, or libraries built with support for other GPUs **HOW TO CHECK?** 
	
## Setup
### Run pre-install script

### Install CV SDK

### Run post-install script

### Try a sample inference application
One of the main advantages of the CV SDK is the accelerated Deep Learning Inference Engine, which also allows you to take advantage of the Intel integrated GPU if you want.
